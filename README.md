# Lotto-Analysis
This project aims to find if there are trends in winning lottery numbers and if so, can one increase their odds of winning by selecting their random numbers within boundaries vs completely randomly.

Initial findings suggest a 3000% growth in the number of wins (odds are still 1 / 7,000,000 so not likely to win at all) when using numbers chosen within boundaries vs completely randomly.
Next steps are to validate this finding by testing with more historical data
